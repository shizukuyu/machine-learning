# HClimRep.ipynb introduction

## Overview
HClimRep.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to climate data analysis and forecasting using deep learning techniques. 
It combines Python's data processing capabilities with advanced machine learning frameworks to model complex climate patterns.
The notebook uses TensorFlow and Keras for building neural networks, enabling researchers to explore climate trends, 
predict future conditions, and identify anomalies with state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

## Functional Overview
Data Processing: Reads climate data from CSV files, performs cleaning and preprocessing.
Time Series Analysis: Displays trends in temperature and precipitation over time.
Spatial Visualization: Uses maps to show climate differences across regions.
Statistical Analysis: Calculates and visualizes statistical characteristics of climate variables.
Anomaly Detection: Identifies outliers and extreme events in climate data.
